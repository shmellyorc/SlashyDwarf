<p>The game's fighting system depends on cards. Every card has his own abilities, his own pros and cons. Those awesome cards are stored in decks. In the beginning of the game you choose a deck you want to start with.</p>
<p>The physical starting deck will contain a series of cards related to melee, physical alignment, or physical effects.</p>
<p>The magic starting deck will contain a series of cards related to magic, magic alignment, or magic effects.</p>
<p>The Alignment starting deck will contain a series of cards related to debuffing, buffing or effecting player or enemy status points.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p>Depending on what starter deck you choose you will receive cards. Each started deck has his own cards, although there are some cards used in all decks, like these:</p>
